# WeatherApp
I created weather application by using angularJS

I used open weather api to get weather data.

We need to enter any city name and press get forecast .It will display two days weather. If we want more than two days ,press
five or seven to know more.


TO RUN THESE APPLICATION

Install node.js
Open command prompt and go to application folder
Type command----------------- http-server (application folder address.)
Server wiil start.
 open browser.
 type address what you got from command prompt
 for example:-- 126.0.0000/8080/index.htm#/
 
 it will succesfully run on your browser.
